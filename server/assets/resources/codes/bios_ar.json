{"morse":{"name":"Morse","bio":"<p><strong>Samuel Morse</strong> (1791 – 1872) was an American inventor and painter. He grew up near Boston and studied at Yale university, before starting a career as an artist.</p><p>On his return journey from a trip to Europe to study art, Morse overheard passengers talking about new electrical devices. This inspired him to work on a significant improvement to the electric telegraph, using just a single wire, and to develop <em>Morse code</em> with his assistant Alfred Vail.</p><p>After some initial difficulties in receiving funding, Morse’s telegraph quickly spread all across the United States and the world.</p><p>Morse also ran twice for mayor of New York City, but his support for slavery and against immigration meant that he was defeated both times.</p>"}}
