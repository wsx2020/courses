by computers every day, it is impossible to take into account all the factors influencing the weather (remember the butterfly). </span><span class=\"sentence\">No set of data is perfect, nor are computers perfect at solving the equations. </span><span class=\"sentence\">The effects of these small errors build up remarkably quickly. </span><span class=\"sentence\">After about ten days it is essentially impossible to forecast weather with any degree of accuracy.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"><span class=\"sentence\"> Chaos is also key to understanding the solar system. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Whilst the motion of the planets is very predictable, the motion of many of the asteroids is not. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Although asteroids do obey Newton's laws, they may well have orbits which move erratically about space. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Such an erratic asteroid is thought to have hit the Earth 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs. </span><span class=\"sentence\">The consequences of a similar incident occurring today are unthinkable; the nature of chaotic motion means that such events are virtually impossible to predict until too late.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"><span class=\"sentence\"> In 1887, the French mathematician Henri Poincaré showed that while Newton’s theory of gravity could perfectly predict how two planetary bodies would orbit under their mutual attraction, adding a third body to the mix rendered the equations unsolvable. </span><span class=\"sentence\">The best we can do for three bodies is to predict their movements moment by moment, and feed those predictions back into our equations … Though the dance of the planets has a lengthy prediction horizon, the effects of chaos cannot be ignored, for the intricate interplay of gravitation tugs among the planets has a large influence on the trajectories of the asteroids. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Keeping an eye on the asteroids is difficult but worthwhile, since such chaotic effects may one day fling an unwelcome surprise our way. </span><span class=\"sentence\">On the flip side, they can also divert external surprises such as steering

describe the possible behaviours of a system geometrically. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Phase space is not (always) like regular space - each location in phase space corresponds to a different configuration of the system. </span><span class=\"sentence\">The behaviour of the system can be observed by placing a point at the location representing the starting configuration and watching how that point moves through the phase space.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"><span class=\"sentence\"> In phase space, a stable system will move predictably towards a very simple attractor (which will look like a single point in the phase space if the system settles down, or a simple loop if the system cycles between different configurations repeatedly). </span><span class=\"sentence\">A chaotic system will also move predictably towards its attractor in phase space - but instead of points or simple loops, we see “strange attractors” appear - complex and beautiful shapes (known as fractals) that twist and turn, intricately detailed at all possible scales.</span></p><p class=\"fixme\"><span class=\"sentence\"> Another feature of chaotic systems is that they can suddenly flip from one behaviour to another, very different, one. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Think about how some kinds of debt can suddenly become a risk rather than an asset to banks. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Such a sudden change is known as a phase transition. </span><span class=\"sentence\">One way to see a phase transition in action is to play with a tap. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Turn it on very slowly and you hear a regular drip, drip, drip. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Turn it up slightly and the drips become more frequent and not all the same size. </span><span class=\"sentence\">A tiny bit more, and the drips become completely irregular and unpredictable: </span><span class=\"sentence\">chaos sets in. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Keep going, and the water settles down to a smooth column. </span><span class=\"sentence\">However once you increase too much, the water starts twisting, frothing and spiralling: </span><span class=\"sentence\">turbulence begins. </span><span class=\"sentence\">By steadily increasing the flow we see regularity and chaos, without leaving the world of determinism.</span></p></x-step>"},{"section":"logistic-map","sectionStatus":"dev","id":"step-18","goals":[],"html":"<x-step id=\"step-18\" goals=\"\"><ul> <li><span
