{"atom":{"title":"Atom","text":"<p><strong>Atoms</strong> are the particles that make up all ordinary matter: solids, liquids, gases and plasma. Atoms consist of a positively-charged <em>core</em> (or <em>nucleus</em>), made up of <em>protons</em> and <em>neutrons</em>, and surrounded by shells of negatively-charged <em>electrons</em>. The diameter of an atom is approximately a ten-millionth of a millimetre.</p>"},"proton":{"title":"Proton","text":"<p>A <strong>proton</strong> is one of the particles that make up the core of an atom. It has a charge of +1. The number of protons in an atom is called its “atomic number”, and it determines what kind of element it is.</p>"},"neutron":{"title":"Neutron","text":"<p>A <strong>neutron</strong> is one of the particles that make up the core of an atom. It has no charge, and has approximately the same mass as a proton.</p>"},"radioactive":{"title":"Radioactive decay","text":"<p><strong>Radioactive decay</strong> is a physical process by which unstable atoms break apart and release energy.</p>"}}
