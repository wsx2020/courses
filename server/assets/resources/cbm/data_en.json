other words, does changing one variable have an impact upon a different variable? </span><span class=\"sentence\">This is important in many instances in real life as it can alter the decisions you make, from a medical diagnosis to an environmental impact or a financial trend.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">You will learn to recognise whether two variables are dependent on or independent of each other and be able to distinguish the similarities and differences between dependence, correlation and cause.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">You will learn about the connections between dependent behaviour and the cause for such behaviour, and how they are often misused. </span><span class=\"sentence\">The final project will be to investigate whether or not there is correlation for a variety of real examples and whether any causation can be inferred.</span></p></div> </x-step>"},{"id":"step-1","section":"chapter-1","goals":[],"html":"<x-step id=\"step-1\" goals=\"\"><h2>What is dependence?</h2><p><span class=\"sentence\">In order to recognise dependence in mathematical visualisations and within data, you first need to understand what it is and how it differs from independence.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\"><strong>Dependence</strong> means that one variable is affected by another, as opposed to independence, which means the variable or event is as likely to happen regardless of other events that could or do occur.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">Many variable quantities in life are related to changes in other quantities. </span><span class=\"sentence\">For example, the size of your shoes is related to your height.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">Decide if these variables are <x-gloss xid=\"dependent-events\">dependent</x-gloss> (one affects the other) or <x-gloss xid=\"independent-events\">independent</x-gloss> (one does not affect the other):</span></p><x-buckets><div

are ready to see if you can recognise them in data.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">Trends in scatter plots can help us to identify dependent events. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Take a look at the examples below to see how they might be recognised.</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\"><strong>Dependence</strong> is a term that is used when one variable affects the behaviour of another.

class=\"sentence\">There are varying levels of dependence. </span><span class=\"sentence\">For example, the amount of milk you can buy completely depends on the amount of money you have, but how late a bus arrives is only slightly dependent on a traffic light being red: </span><span class=\"sentence\">it could also be affected by how many people took a long time to find their change, the amount of traffic on the road or the mood or driving habits of the bus driver. </span><span class=\"sentence\">So would the amount of dependence of these two events look different on a scatter plot?</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">The amount of dependence can be quantified on a scatter plot. </span><span class=\"sentence\">It is time for you to see if you can spot these greater or lesser dependencies. </span><span class=\"sentence\">You already know how to identify scatter plots depicting strong upward or downward trends, but can you work out which ones have just some dependence or none at all?</span></p><p><span class=\"sentence\">Now we will look at the same six plots and try to decide which of them show more dependence than others. </span><span class=\"sentence\">Drag them into a rank order, from the most dependent upward (positive) at the top to the most dependent downward (negative) at the bottom.</span></p></x-step>"},{"section":"chapter-2","id":"step-4","goals":[],"html":"<x-step id=\"step-4\" goals=\"\"><p><span
