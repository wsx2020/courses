## Introduction

Despite how “obvious” they might appear today, many discoveries in mathematics took centuries
before they became widely accepted. This is particularly visible when we talk about one of the most
fundamental concepts in mathematics: different types of numbers.

Humans have counted using the [natural numbers](gloss:natural-numbers) for at least 20,000 years.
Mathematicians in ancient Egypt also developed fractions, and students of Pythagoras in ancient
Greece discovered the first [irrational number](gloss:irrational-numbers): `§sqrt(2)`. They were
initially terrified by this discovery, and – according to legend – tried to cover up its existence
because it didn't fit into their pure, perfect model of the world.

Negative numbers and zero proved even harder. In ancient Greece, numbers were defined geometrically.
Numbers that couldn’t be directly measured or represented by lines, curves, or shapes were not even
considered. Over the next 1000 years, different Asian and Arabic civilisations developed number
systems that included zero and negatives, but even in the 16th century, some European mathematicians
called equations with negative solutions “false” or “absurd.”

It was around this time that the Italian mathematician [Girolamo Cardano](bio:cardano) was writing
an important treatise about mathematics, his _Ars magna_. Here is one of the problems he
was trying to solve:

{.quote} “Split 10 into two parts, such that their product is 40.”

Today, we might instead try to _“find two numbers whose sum is 10 and whose product is 40”_. Can you
think of two numbers that satisfy these conditions?

There don’t seem to be any obvious solutions, but Algebra had been invented just a few centuries
before Cardano was born. Let’s try to write the problem as an equation:

::: x-algebra-flow

`x + y = 10 x * y = 40`

* Let the two numbers be _x_ and _y_. From the information in the problem, we can write two equations.
* We can rearrange equation 1 to isolate _x_ on the left-hand side.
* {.new-row} Now we can substitute this value of _x_ into the second equation.
* {.new-row} If we expand the brackets, we get a quadratic equation.

At this stage, most mathematicians would have stopped, because you [[can’t take square roots of
negative numbers | always need to have two results | need to solve the equation for _x_, not _y_]].

{.todo} More about this, parabolae etc.

Of course, 

Basic and established rules about numbers made solving this equation seem impossible. But this difficulty was not limited to this one problem. The issue of taking the square root of a negative number popped up everywhere for Cardano and his contemporaries. It appeared in the complicated cubic and quartic equations they were studying, but also in simple quadratic equations like x2+1=0.



What made Cardano special is that, instead of stopping and giving up, he took a different approach. He was the first to say: Maybe this only seems impossible. Maybe we don’t think we have the numbers to solve this problem, but we actually do. In other words, Cardano proceeded to solve the problem as if -15 existed, despite all evidence to the contrary. His solution, updated only to use modern notation, is shown below:

---

* Justify that x² = –1 has no real solutions by using a graph of y = x². 
* Comprehend that the symbol i means the positive square root of -1 and that an
  imaginary number is a real number times i.
* Understand and use the terms ‘real part’ and ‘imaginary part.
* Geometrical representation of complex numbers in the Argand diagram.
