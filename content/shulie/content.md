# 数列

## 介绍
> section:introduction

数列是高中数学的重要内容，又是学习高等数学的基础。高考对本章的考查比较全面，等差数列，等比数列的考查每年都不会遗漏。
有关数列的试题经常是综合题，经常把数列知识和指数函数、对数函数和不等式的知识综合起来。

1. 数列本身的有关知识，其中有等差数列与等比数列的概念、性质、通项公式以及求和公式

2. 数列与其它知识的结合，其中有数列与函数、方程、不等式、三角、几何的结合

### What is dependence?

In order to recognise dependence in mathematical visualisations and within data, you first need to
understand what it is and how it differs from independence.

__Dependence__ means that one variable is affected by another, as opposed to independence, which
means the variable or event is as likely to happen regardless of other events that could or do occur.

Many variable quantities in life are related to changes in other quantities. For example, the size
of your shoes is related to your height.

Decide if these variables are [dependent](gloss:dependent-events) (one affects the other) or
[independent](gloss:independent-events) (one does not affect the other):

    x-buckets
      .inputs
        .input(bucket="1") The temperature of water from a hot tab, and the size of the tab.
        .input(bucket="0") The size of a computer screen, and the number of pixels it has.
        .input(bucket="0") The cost to rent a house (in a given area), and the number of bedrooms it has.
        .input(bucket="1") The weight of a baby at birth, and the day of the week on which it is born.
        .input(bucket="0") The time since the launch of a mobile phone, and the amount of storage it has.
        .input(bucket="1") The number of puppies a dog has, and the length of the tail of the dog.
      .buckets
        .bucket
          .title Dependent
        .bucket
          .title Independent

### Do scatter plots help us recognise dependencies?

Now that you understand the difference between a dependent and an independent event, you are ready
to see if you can recognise them in data.

Trends in scatter plots can help us to identify dependent events. Take a look at the examples below
to see how they might be recognised.

__Dependence__ is a term that is used when one variable affects the behaviour of another. Below are
six plots that may or may not have dependent x and y variables. Drag each slider slowly to the right
and try to spot the trend. For further help, hover on the info icon in the top-right-hand corner.

Let's see if you have understood how to recognise dependence within scatter plots.

You should now be able to identify a scatter plot that depicts a simple dependency and be able to
see whether a trend is going up or down.

### Do scatter plots help us recognise the amount of dependency?

There are varying levels of dependence. For example, the amount of milk you can buy completely
depends on the amount of money you have, but how late a bus arrives is only slightly dependent on
a traffic light being red: it could also be affected by how many people took a long time to find
their change, the amount of traffic on the road or the mood or driving habits of the bus driver. So
would the amount of dependence of these two events look different on a scatter plot?

The amount of dependence can be quantified on a scatter plot. It is time for you to see if you can
spot these greater or lesser dependencies. You already know how to identify scatter plots depicting
strong upward or downward trends, but can you work out which ones have just some dependence or none
at all?

Now we will look at the same six plots and try to decide which of them show more dependence than
others. Drag them into a rank order, from the most dependent upward (positive) at the top to the
most dependent downward (negative) at the bottom.
