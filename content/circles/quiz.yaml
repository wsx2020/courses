  text: What is the area of a circle with radius {r}m?
  choices:
    - `{r}π`m
    - `{r^2}π`m
    - `{r}^2`m
    - `{r}π^2`m
  hints:
    - Remember that the area of a circle with radius `r` is given by the formula `A = π r^2`.
    - In this case, `r = {10}`, so what do we get for `A`?
  variables:
    # r: [5, 8, 10, 12, 20]
    # r1: [5...50] :5

  text: What is the circumference of a circle with radius 4cm?
  choices:
    - `4π`
    - `8π`
    - `16π`
  hints:
    - Remember that the circumference of a circle with radius `r` is given by the formula `C = 2 π r`.
